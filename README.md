## Dataset
The training and testing data is provided by [PCSOD](https://git.openi.org.cn/OpenDatasets/PCSOD-Dataset/datasets).

---

## Train
```bash
python train.py
```

## Evaluate
```bash
python test.py
```
You can directly obtain our visualization results from [here](), or download our pretrained model. The checkpoints can be found [here]().
